# Natalie Assistant ðŸ’¬âœ¨
Natalie is an intelligent, voice-controlled holographic AI assistant designed to assist developers â€” especially those with physical limitations â€” in managing tasks like coding support, email control, and phone functions. Inspired by Natalie from the Ironheart series, this assistant aims to go beyond screen-based AI by offering holographic interaction and real-time voice conversations.

Notes: For now, Natalie runs as a desktop AI. Hologram integration (e.g., Pepperâ€™s Ghost or true 3D projection) is planned in future phases. Natalie will evolve into a full assistant capable of controlling phones, emails, and smart systems.
